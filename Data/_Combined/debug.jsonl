thats mainly it exc I dont wrong with that picture exc um the cookie jar is overflowing and thats about it exc okay here is another picture this picture tells a story so look at everything thats happening in this picture and tell me a story with a beginning a middle and an end oh aw kitty cat alright exc the beginning is that the cat climbed up the tree and got too far out and now is scared to jump down um a little girl is really upset because thats her kitty um the daddy were assuming its the dad or a adult male climbed up the tree but the branch is too light for him to get out to the kitty um so somebody called nine one one oh and the dog is really excited and just barking trying to help um so the firemen are coming I guess with the second ladder because the proportions arent um so theyre coming to help get the dad and the down and I guess the bird is just sitting there with thing tweeting away um I mean we dont see it in the picture but the ending looks like it will be that theyll put a ladder up against a tree and rescue the dad and hopefully rescue the kitty although kitties have a tendency to climb up further in the tree when theyre scared youknow I dont know exc theyll figure out some sort of way alright to rescue the the kitty great here is another picture this is two pictures in one so something at the top and something at the bottom and I want you to tell me a story about this picture tell me a story with a beginning a middle and an end well lets see exc two separate pictures exc well they go together right exc Im just trying to enlarge them on my phone exc oh okay well this exc are you allowed to tell me exc it looks like a Norman Rockwell painting or paintings of um well it looks like theyre going on a family vacation yeah its its the same guy well no I dunno if it is um but it looks like theyre going for a family drive and I Im not sure if the driver I dont think hes the same guy even though hes very similar because the guy on the top is clean shaven oh geez exc now I dont want it exc okay exc are you there exc yes okay exc well the top picture looks a bit more it looks like theyre going on a family outing and is that woman wearing a hijab that that doesnt seem right exc well I cant enlarge this any further exc but I think I I see a scarf which either be a hijab or a just I think an old fashioned Norman Rockwell painting um so its probably just a scarf and the kids are excited and the dog is excited and the youknow the girls blowing a bubble from bubblegum not sure what the kid in the very back is doing and it looks like in bottom they had a fun time at the beach or where they were going but theyre all exhausted and it looks like a child grandma and another child um thats sitting in the backseat but the child in the back looks tired they all except for the dog look more tired and angry um probably theyre just tired and they go home and wash themselves off and maybe grandmas youknow visiting for a while and whoever this young child is um no no wait a minute exc I think I see grandma in the backseat also in the top picture but at any rate they all look tired and angry dis disgruntled and theyre gonna go home and maybe have dinner or just go home and wash then go to sleep okay um well lets look at the next one are you familiar with the story of Cinderella oh of course okay so were gonna take a few thats a Disney version yeah were gonna take a few minutes to look through some pictures to help remind you of the story and then youll have the opportunity to tell me the story in your own words alright do you see the pictures popping on your screen yeah okay so take a look yeah oh nasty stepsister mhm okay so now Id like you to tell me the story of Cinderella in your own words you can use any information that you already knew about the story as well as from the pictures that we just looked at okay exc what if I put like a feminist slant to it which is my background exc I will love it go for it okay exc alright exc once upon a time you have to start with those words exc um there lived a girl her mother had died father had remarried um by the way are you gonna be flipping pictures exc or do I just tell you the whole thing exc no you just tell it okay exc um her father remarried but her stepmother and two stepsisters were mean um they made her do all the nasty chores and her one space in the house was sitting by the fire by the ashes and the cinders her name was Ella and because she was sitting near the cinders she got the name Cinderella and the prince of the land was looking for a wife and invited all the eligible females to a ball the whatever um and she uh Cinderella really wanted to go the stepsisters were getting all dial dolled up and she somehow or other in the Disney version she had animals and birds and things helping her make this beautiful dress um I forget how she first did exc at any rate she she went downstairs as her stepsisters and stepmom were leaving for the ball s they saw her in this beautiful dress and they tore it to shreds and left for the ball and she went into the garden or somewhere and went out weeping and crying and all of a sudden poof her fairy godmother appeared and talked to her and tapped her wand a few times and said youre going to the ball and she made this youknow beautiful carriage appear from I think it was mice turned into horses um and this is where I go into singing its possible for a plain yellow pumpkin to become a golden carriage its possible and four white mice can always be four white horses such and Cinderella had said to the fairy godmother this is the Rogers and Hammerstein version I can remember this kind of stuff exc its so much fun remembering it exc um and youknow they went off to the ball um with Cinderella and a beautiful dress and um and glass slippers um looking absolutely beautiful and she came into the ball and her stepmom and stepsisters didnt recognize her but all of a sudden the prince saw her and it was love at first sight and they danced some wonderful dances and they fell in love but her fairy godmother had warned her to um that she had to leave by midnight because then the spell would undo and the the uh great big clock began to bong bong bong at midnight uh at midnight and she ran out of the castle down the steps and left one of her glass slippers behind and she um um she gradually got transformed back into the her regular clothes and just being Cinderella the prince was obsessed with her and had a whole huge search throughout the kingdom through youknow everywhere they went door to door going youknow the with this glass slipper youknow the one who this glass slipper fits is the maiden who who will be my my bride um and the stepsisters hearing about it had great big ugly feet and depending on the version you read youknow they cut off their heels they cut off their toes to try and be able to fit into that shoe when the prince and his um minions visited him and they came to her house somehow Cinderella crept out into the open managed to get noticed and her foot was the only foot that fit into that glass slipper and the prince recognized her and brought her to the castle and made her his wife and they all lived happily ever after alright thank you for this one well do it a little different I can remember exc go ahead did you wanna say something else yeah exc well I I can remember stuff like that easily exc that youknow its where my keys are that are the hard part exc right well well get to that too well get to that too okay for this one please tell me how you would make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich okay exc you get two slices of bread out one or two actually it doesnt matter much um and you get out your peanut butter

so do y let me understand exc the two pictures are of the same thing exc yes theyre two pictures together in one um oh okay exc okay exc so the family has started out on a family outing it has mother and dad all of them in the car the little boy and his the little girl ma brother and sister their pet and another brother with grandma in the back and theyre off to have a good time and uh theyre on their way to someplace fun to go for the afternoon and then later in the evening because its starting to become evening uh they head back everyones tired dad just wants to get home hes intent on driving mom and one of the kids have fallen asleep in moms lap in the front seat uh the two of the kids brother and sister and the dog are all looking out the window not as excited as they were and bright as they were on the way out but theyre youknow tired from the day and theyre kinda just waiting to get home in meantime grandma and one of the uh kids is in the backseat um just waiting to get home obviously tired from the day okay Im going to ask you to tell a story have you heard of the story of Cinderella laughs yes okay do you remember much about it well I just went to the Walt Disney one hundredth celebration and I saw the s glass slipper oh wow thats so fun so these pictures might remind you of how it goes so take a look at these pictures and then Ill put the book away and ask you to tell me the story in your own words okay now tell me as much of the story of Cinderella as you can you can use any details you know about this story as well as the pictures you just looked at Cinderella was a lovely young lady who unfortunately lost her mom and hadta live with her stepmom and stepsisters I say unfortunatelyq because they thought of Cinderella more as a servant to help them and take care of them as opposed to being any part of the family or a significant human being in their family so they treated her uh with disdain and they ordered her around they made her do work would never let her do anything fun but Cinderella had a wonderful imagination she was full of joy and she shill still pw still tried to find happiness in every day and tried to do what she could to help both the stepmom and the stepsisters feel good and then one day the prince of the land needed to find a wife and so he was going out to find who his wife should be and he had this beautiful glass slipper that he was going to try on every woman single woman in the kingdom to see who might be the one whos a perfect fit for him and Cinderella was enthralled and was dreaming of being able to participate in this but of course her stepmom and um ugly stepsisters had other ideas instead they wanted Cinderella to help the two ugly sisters get ready for the the opportunity and meantime meantime Cinderella helped as best she could and then after they had left uh her fairy godmother came t and actually with the help of several like mice and others she was able to dress Cinderella in a beautiful dress make her up and make her so beautiful and they she got a a pumpkin and made it into a beautiful carriage tur some mice were turned into uh for the pumpkin as well coachman for the hu pumpkin as well as horses for the pumpkin and Cinderella went to the ball and was ultimately uh was able to try on the glass slipper and it fit perfectly and but the whole problem with all this she hadta be home by the time the clock struck twelve when the spell would be over and uh pump the pumpkin coach would turn back into a pumpkin she would lose all of her regalia and beautiful garments and beauty and it would be back into her servant clothes and the mice would become mice and so just about the time um when she discovered and the prince had discovered this may be her his perfect match with her fitting perfectly into the slipper she the star clock began to strike twelve and she realized ho what time it was and ran down the stairs ran out and got in the pumpkin but in the process she lost one of the slippers and so um she made it home and quite frankly Im no Im drawing a blank right now in terms of how the prince finally found her again but he did laughs and stepsis stepmoms stepmom ms and the sisters were very upset by it but she became uh wedded to the prince and lived happily ever after okay www okay lets move on to something a little different tell me how you would make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich laughs with the best two slices of bread I can find and then uh crunchy peanut butter and you take the peanut butter you take the two pieces of bread and on one piece of bread you spread the peanut butter uh preferably crunchy and uh then on the other side you spread jelly preferably s a jelly you like like strawberry jelly uh actually I preser I I prefer preserves and then you put the two slices together with the peanut butter and the jelly and then you slice the the sandwich in a diagonal to make a half so you have a half and you have the other half to share with your friend now I like the crust some people like to cut off the crust", "Text_participant": "www . well , a little boy's getting in a cookie jar to give it to the little girl .
